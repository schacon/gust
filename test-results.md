# Test Results

Updated: 2026-05-19

- `cargo build --release -p grit-cli`: pass.
- `cargo fmt --check`: pass after formatting.
- `cargo check`: pass.
- `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`: completed, but the workspace still reports many pre-existing clippy warnings; clippy also reported failed auto-fixes in unrelated files.
- `cargo test -p grit-lib --lib`: pass, 199/199.
- `./tests/harness/run.sh`: skipped; project uses `./scripts/run-tests.sh` for CSV/dashboard updates.
- Focus harness: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t1510-repo-setup.sh` pass, 109/109.
- Companion harness: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t1517-outside-repo.sh` still 185/191; first remaining failure is `git apply` outside a repository, not repo setup discovery.
